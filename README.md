#### Fun Facts About Me

- **Triple Threat in Tech.**
  I’m not a product designer, but I seriously can’t stand ugly designs, so I always try to make things look better in my code. I’m a frontend developer and a software engineer, which means I don’t just make things pretty; I make them work, too. I’m always learning and leveling up.

- **“That Girl” Energy**  
I’m all about becoming the best version of myself and sharing that journey one aesthetic vlog, code push, and cozy room setup at a time. Cozy minimalism is my vibe! I love making my space a peaceful, intentional escape. I enjoy self-care and body care

- **Code by Day, Paint by Heart**  
When I’m not debugging or designing, you’ll find me painting. It’s my way of balancing logic and creativity.

- **God First, Always**  
I tithe 10% of my income,a reflection of my faith and discipline.

- **Tiktok & LinkedIn Baddie**  
I’m building my digital presence strategically, sharing lifestyle and career content to uplift and inspire anyone who needs a confidence boost.

- **I Love Helping People Feel Seen**  
I’m always thinking of ways to make life easier or better for others.

- **Not Afraid to Start Over**  
Switching gears in code or pivoting my personal brand? I’m comfortable being a work in progress and that’s where the magic happens.
