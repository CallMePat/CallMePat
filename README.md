## âœ¨ A Few Fun Facts

- **Creative Coder at Heart**  
  Though not a product designer, I care deeply about clean, user-friendly design and always aim to reflect that in my work.

- **Intentional Living**  
  Cozy minimalism is my thing. I love curating spaces and routines that reflect peace and purpose.

- **Faith & Balance**  
  My faith keeps me grounded, and painting helps me stay creatively refreshed outside of code.

- **Content Creator Vibes**  
  I share lifestyle and tech content on LinkedIn and TikTok to inspire others and build a thoughtful digital presence.

- **Always Evolving**  
  Whether itâ€™s iterating on code or rebranding myself, I embrace growth and starting fresh when needed.
